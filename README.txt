To compile and run bioFLOW, do the following steps:

1- Extract libs.7z and libs2.7z in the current folder. You must have both Eigen/ and boost/ folders in the current folder after the extraction.

2- Open the project using Qt Creator (MinGW version). Refer to bioFLOW.pro to open the project.

3- Go to 'Projects' tab (the vertical bar on the left) to configure the compilator. Make sure 'Shadow build' is checked, and take note of the 'build folder' (usually bioFLOW-***-Debug). The build folder should be located in the same parent folder of bioFLOW project folder.

4- Extract folders.7z in the 'build folder' (NOT IN THE CURRENT FOLDER).

5- Compile and run the project by clicking on the green arrow in the vertical bar (bottom left), or simply tap Ctrl+R.
